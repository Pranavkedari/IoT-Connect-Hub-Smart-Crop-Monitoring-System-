# IoT-Connect-Hub-Smart-Crop-Monitoring-System-
This project presents a novel Internet of Things (IoT) system for real-time monitoring and 
management of crop health. The system leverages an ESP8266 microcontroller with built-in 
Wi-Fi to collect environmental data from various sensors and transmit it wirelessly to a cloud 
platform. The sensors employed include a DHT11 for temperature and humidity, a PIR sensor 
for motion detection, and a soil moisture sensor for monitoring water content. Additionally, an 
LCD display provides on-site visualization of these critical parameters. 
 
The Blynk application serves as the user interface, allowing remote access to sensor data and 
enabling control of the irrigation system. The system automatically activates a water pump 
based on pre-defined soil moisture thresholds, promoting water conservation and optimized 
crop growth. This project demonstrates the potential of IoT technology to revolutionize 
agriculture by empowering farmers with data-driven insights for informed decision-making, 
leading to improved crop yields and resource efficiency. 
 
In every country agriculture is done from ages which are considered to be science and also art 
of cultivating plants. In day today life, technology is updating and it is also necessary to trend 
up agriculture too. IoT plays a key role in smart agriculture. Internets of Things (IoT) sensors 
are used to provide necessary information about agriculture fields. The main advantage of IoT 
is to monitor the agriculture by using the wireless sensor networks and collect the data from 
different sensors which are deployed at various no des and send by wireless protocol. By using 
IoT system the smart agriculture is powered by NodeMCU. It includes the humidity sensor, 
temperature sensor, moisture sensor and DC motor. This system starts to check the humidity 
and moisture level. The sensors are used to sense the level of water and if the level is below 
the range then the system automatically stars watering. According to the change in temperature 
level the sensor does its job. IoT also shows the information of humidity, moisture level by 
including
